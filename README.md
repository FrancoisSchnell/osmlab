2008 : OSMaware is a Python command-line tool  which takes an OSM .osc file (a change set in OSM map over time) and produces a KML file of the mappers activity.

KMLs are available in mainly three versions:

V0 shows only one placemark per user with summary informations and are mainly intended for big files like world day or hour changes.
V1 is the most detailed version with one placemark per node but produces big KMLs.
V2 shows all the nodes but in the form of polygons instead of placemarks and is "lighter" than V1.
