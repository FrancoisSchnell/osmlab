As of 2008: OSMaware is a Python command-line tool  which takes an OSM .osc file (a change set in OSM map over time) and produces a KML file of the mappers activity.

KMLs are available in three versions: 
* V0 shows only one placemark per user with summary informations and are mainly intended for big files like world day or hour changes.
* V1 is the most detailed version with one placemark per node but produces big KMLs.
* V2 shows all the nodes but in the form of polygons instead of placemarks and is "lighter" than V1.
